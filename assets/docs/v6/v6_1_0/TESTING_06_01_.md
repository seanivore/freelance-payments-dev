# Testing v6.1.0

---

## Testing Notes 
+ **Testing Date:** 2026-01-29
+ **Status:** Testing fixes from `LOG_06_00.md` 
+ **Logging:** `LOG_06_01.md`
+ **Test Files:** 
  - `uid-yae-576.json` - Jameson; yaes-baked-goods
  - `uid-lir-969.json` - Smith; liruns-furniture
  - `uid-dnj-781.json` - Smith; djs-bakery
  - `uid-qdw-666.json` - Wallace; qdw-portfolio
  - `uid-ymf-021.json` - McFarland; ymf-ai-podcast

### Testing Focus 

+ Okay, so now I will check that this flow works, period. I'm not even going to try the PDF download mid-flow on mobile at first. 
+ If PDF download mid-flow is the problematic item, exclusively, then we can remove the download PDF from mid-flow 
  - Could be removed completely, or just on mobile 
  - There are already PDF download buttons available on the Completion1 and Completion2 pages 
+ **Removing the PDF download mid-flow might actually make more sense anyway because in an upcoming update we will need to add functionality so that the client's signature and date of signing are added to the actual PDF before they download it.**

## Test: "uid-yae-576.json"  --- desktop success ✅
+ Jameson, yaes-baked-goods

### Events Needed
+ Session #2
  - API call — `state.client_status.balance` 
  - API call — `state.client_status.payment_2`, `price2.active = "false"`, `product.active = "false"` 

### Environment
+ Mobile, incognito window, Safari, iOS 26.2.1 (literally just updated minutes ago)

### Test
+ Session #2 *without* PDF download behavior; **all behavior was as expected** 

---

## Test: "uid-lir-969.json" --- desktop success ✅
+ Smith, liruns-furniture

### Events Needed
+ Session #2
  - API call — `state.client_status.balance` 
  - API call — `state.client_status.payment_2`, `price2.active = "false"`, `product.active = "false"` 

### Environment
+ Desktop, incognito window, Safari, macOS Tahoe 26.2 

### Test
+ Session #2 *with* PDF download behavior; **all behavior was as expected** 

---

## Test: "uid-dnj-781.json" --- mobile success ✅
+ Smith, djs-bakery

### Events Needed
+ Session #2
  - API call — `state.client_status.balance` 
  - API call — `state.client_status.payment_2`, `price2.active = "false"`, `product.active = "false"` 

### Environment
+ Mobile, incognito window, Google Chrome, iOS 26.2.1

### Test
+ Session #2 *with* PDF download behavior; **all behavior was as expected** 

### Notes 
+ iOS Chrome downloads the PDF without opening a new tab; no need to test again unless there are event separation issues 

---

## Test: "uid-qdw-666.json" --- mobile success ✅
+ Wallace, qdw-portfolio

### Events Needed
+ Session #1
  - API call — `state.client_status.invoice` 
  - API call — `state.client_status.payment_1`, `price1.active = "false"`
+ Session #2
  - API call — `state.client_status.balance` 
  - API call — `state.client_status.payment_2`, `price2.active = "false"`, `product.active = "false"` 

### Environment
+ Mobile, incognito window, Safari, iOS 26.2.1

### Test 

+ Session #1 *without* PDF download behavior; **all behavior was as expected** 
+ Session #2 *with* PDF download behavior; **all behavior was as expected** 

### Notes 

+ I tried to close the PDF tab and discovered that the PDF is opened in the SAME TAB as the app flow, after saving I clicked "BACK" and the app flow resumed. 
+ Follow-up
  - Try the PDF download again in a new end-to-end test 
  - Then if it doesn't work and splits up the events, we could consider adding something to make the PDF open in a new tab (?) 
  - Though doing this might make it function weird in browsers where it *does* download as expected (?) 
  - **Better solution if it is still problematic would probably be to remove the download buttons from in the flow and save them only for Completion1 and Completion2**

## Test: "uid-ymf-021.json" -- LEFT OFF HERE BECAUSE OF VERCEL DEPLOYMENT RATE LIMIT 🔴
+ McFarland, ymf-ai-podcast

### Events Needed
+ Session #1
  - API call — `state.client_status.logged_in`, `state.client_status.invoice`, `state.client_status.contract_signed`, `contract.signatures.client.legal_name`, `contract.signatures.client.date_signed` 
  - API call — `state.client_status.payment_1`, `price1.active = "false"` 
+ Session #2

  - ✓ Updated payment_1: 2026-01-29T14:19:13.716Z
  - ✓ Deactivated price1
+ Session #2 with PDF download behavior; **all behavior was as expected** 

### Notes 

+ We should look into the logic of why there is a duplicate logged_in event 
  - The purpose of the FIRST event being "logged_in" is to make sure the client started the process 
  - It is not relevant as an FYI in these later states 
  - Further, if events were skipped, and it logged the logged_in event, then it isn't actually accurate for its purpose 
  - **PLEASE REMOVE: I have asked this of the agent at least the past three sessions in Cursor, and it remains, providing inaccurate information when it shows up like this**

## Conclusions & Updates To Be Made 

### PDF Download Behavior Testing Inconclusive 

+ Didn't get a full enough test to check if the PDF download is causing issues with the event API calls 

**Remove PDF Download Button from mid-flow** 

+ Remove the PDF download button from the toolbar on mobile and desktop for contract, invoice, and balance screens 
+ We'll adapt the homepage copy to eliminate any confusion from clients wanting a copy before reaching the end of the flow 
+ The **Completion Page PDF download buttons** should remain 
  - These are on Completion1 and Completion2  
+ Please make sure that these **download with the appropriate file names** 
  - File names reflect the invoice numbers, mirroring the Job ID 
  - Contract example: kon-xxx-xxx.pdf 
  - Invoice example: inv-xxx-xxx.pdf 
  - Balance example: bal-xxx-xxx.pdf 

**Current homepage login form modal copy**

HORVATH PAYMENTS 
Login to access your contract and invoices.

**New homepage login form modal copy**

HORVATH PAYMENTS 
Sign contract, make payments, and download documents.

### Contract Page 

**Current toolbar copy** 
LEFT ALIGNED -- CONTRACT FOR YOUR REVIEW. 
RIGHT ALIGNED -- (download icon) ("Sign Contract" button)

**New toolbar copy** 
LEFT ALIGNED -- Hi, {{client.first_name}}. 
RIGHT ALIGNED -- ("Sign Contract" button)

+ Please take the job JSON mapped value `customer.name` and remove everything except the first word before any spaces. 
  - Some clients have a middle name but we will always make sure to have at least the first name, followed by a space, and then the remaining names. 
  - This way we will always have a valid greeting on this app contract page view. 
  - Please use the same font that "CONTRACT FOR YOUR REVIEW." is already using. 
  - But please use camel case like: `Hi, Claude.` 
  - And then please leave the same font and case that is already applied to "Sign Contract" button. 
+ Notice the removal of the 'download icon'

### Invoice Page 

**Current toolbar copy** 
LEFT ALIGNED -- INVOICE FOR YOUR RECORDS. 
RIGHT ALIGNED -- (download icon) ("Continue to Payment" button)

**New toolbar copy** 
LEFT ALIGNED -- You owe {{payment1_due}}
RIGHT ALIGNED -- ("Pay Now" button)

+ The `{{payment1_due}}` value is the same placeholder text we use on the Invoice PDF template.
  - Please use that same value and apply the same formatting as is applied for the Invoice PDF. 
  - Please use the same font that "INVOICE FOR YOUR RECORDS." is already using.
  - But please use camel case like: `You owe $21,340.30` 
  - For clarity, do not use the period after the amount
  - Please leave the same font and case that is already applied to the "Continue to Payment" button, but with the new text "Pay Now" 
+ Notice the removal of the 'download icon'

### Balance Page 

**Current toolbar copy** 
LEFT ALIGNED -- BALANCE STATEMENT FOR FINAL PAYMENT. 
RIGHT ALIGNED -- (download icon) ("Confirm & Continue to Payment" button)

**New toolbar copy** 
LEFT ALIGNED -- {{payment2_due}} remaining.
RIGHT ALIGNED -- ("Pay Now" button)

+ The `{{payment2_due}}` value is the same placeholder text we use on the Balance PDF template.
  - Please use that same value and apply the same formatting as is applied for the Balance PDF. 
  - Please use the same font that "BALANCE STATEMENT FOR FINAL PAYMENT." is already using.
  - But please use camel case like: `$9,100.00 remaining.`
  - Here, there is a period after the statement.
  - Please leave the same font and case that is already applied to the "Continue to Payment" button, but with the new text "Pay Now" 
+ Notice the removal of the 'download icon'

### Completion Pages 

**Consolidate the PDF download buttons into one button** 

+ The `Completion1` and `Completion2` pages should have one "Download PDFs" button 
  - Under the button, add small text "Download the agreement and invoices." 
  - On both pages, the button will download ALL THREE PDFs; there's no reason they can't see the balance invoice ahead of time
+ Downloading all three PDFs as one file 
  - Can one button trigger a download of multiple files? 
  - If not we could .zip them... but that's kind of weird 
  - Ideally we can combine the three PDFs so that the invoices are after the contract 
  - Contract, Invoice, Balance

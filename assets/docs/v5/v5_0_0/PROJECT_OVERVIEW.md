# Comprehensive Project Overview 
*Testing is completed on the liv site:* `https://dev.payments.august.style`

## Summary 

  + Payments site for freelance clients. Login, get contract PDF, sign it, get invoice PDFs, then make payments

## Project's Dual Purpose

  1. **Primary**: A micro-site SPA for freelance clients to login, view and sign their contract, download their invoices, and pay for services.
  2. **Secondary**: A learning project to repurpose portfolio website architecture for a client's online art store website.

### Architecture Foundation

**Portfolio Base Architecture** (Original System):
- Simple HTML/CSS/JS build with 2 HTML template pages that load data from a directory of 30+ JSON files
- SPA-style routing using a 404-redirect trick to host a dynamic site on free, static GitHub Pages host
- GitHub Action Workflow auto-builds `assets/js/manifest.json` file to map login keywords to JSON files
- See `assets/docs/RESOURCES/OG_JSON_ARCH_PORTFOLIO.md` for original architecture details

**Payment Site Adaptations**:
- Integrated Stripe Custom UI Components for payments
- PDF generation using Google Docs Templates (contract, invoice, balance)
- Expanded automations to create Stripe objects and PDFs via GitHub Actions
- Event tracking system to record user behavior and state progression

## Objective 

  + Convey full understanding of platform for Freelance Client Contract and Invoices Payments; from big picture expectations, to details about recent refactoring changes, logic updates made, and some current and persistent issue areas encountered throughout the build process 
  + This prepares you to apply your development, engineering, and design expertise to help us through final stretch 
  + Please keep clear planing, bug fixing, refactoring updates, and testing details 
    - Put in organized files within our new `docs/v5` directory 
    - Ensures that we can track progress and understand the full scope of the project as it evolves 

### Technical Overview 

  1. We use a unique SPA architecture that provides dynamic website functionality on a static GitHub Pages host using a 404-redirect method  
  2. This build provides a strong foundation for our self-maintaining application, facilitating production, maintenance, and presentation of Freelance Client's contracts and invoices for signature and record-keeping, and then enabling ability to make payments through Stripe Custom Component-based payment processing integration 
  3. These fully automated processes both use data provided by a single-JSON file per freelance job as well as record new data and artifacts that are needed by the application to drive the various user flows, automated production flows, and tracking workflows 
  4. These are created through a combination of Vercel serverless functions, from Stripe Webhooks and API calls, and finally, GitHub Actions; together these details help the application know exactly where in the User's process to place them when they leave and return to the platform 

  **IMPORTANT:** 
    + Always use `git add .` 
    + Then normal `git commit -m "Your message"` 
    + Then always `git smart-push` 
      - Intelligently sorts which conflict updated files to keep from remove versus local 
      - Created to prevent a TON of merged file errors 

### Event Tracking System Architecture

**How Events Are Collected**:
- Events are collected in the frontend (`src/App.tsx`) using an event buffer stored in `useRef`
- Events accumulate during the user session: `logged_in`, `contract_signed`, `invoice_acknowledged`, `balance_acknowledged`, `payment_1`, `payment_2`
- Events are NOT sent immediately - they're batched together

**When Events Are Flushed**:
Events are sent as a single batch to `/api/track-event` when:
1. **10 minutes of inactivity** - Timer resets on user activity (mouse, keyboard, scroll, touch)
2. **Payment completion** - Immediate flush via `flushOnPayment()` callback
3. **Browser unload** - `beforeunload`, `pagehide`, or `visibilitychange` events (uses `fetch` with `keepalive: true`)

**Event Flow**:
```
Frontend (React) → Event Buffer (useRef) → /api/track-event (Vercel) → GitHub Actions → user_exit_events.py → JSON Update
```

**Key Files**:
- `src/App.tsx` - Event collection, buffering, and flushing logic
- `api/track-event.js` - Receives batch, dispatches GitHub Actions workflow
- `.github/workflows/user-exit-events.yml` - Processes events, updates JSON
- `.github/scripts/orchestration/user_exit_events.py` - Python script that updates JSON with timestamps, signatures, price flags

**What Gets Updated**:
- `state.client_status.*` - Timestamps for each event (logged_in, contract_signed, invoice, balance, payment_1, payment_2)
- `contract.signatures.client.*` - Legal name and signed date from contract signing
- `price1.active`, `price2.active`, `product.active` - Set to `false` after payments complete

### End-to-End Data & User Flow 

  + The following is illustrative of User and user-behavior event tracking. It does not specifically illustrate exactly where and through what service data travels; e.g. the user-behavior events on the front end of the website are sent through Vercel serverless functions to get to the GitHub Actions backend. Stripe events come through webhook which Vercel also currently captures initially. 

- **ADMIN ADDS PROJECT JOB** -> `(01)` New Job JSON uploaded -> `(02)` Stripe catalog objects created -> `(03)` Stripe object artifacts added back to JSON -> `(04)` Job contract, invoice, and balance PDFs produced -> `(05)` PDF artifacts added to JSON -> **PLATFORM READY FOR CLIENT** -> `(06)` Client login -> `(07)` First user workflow event trigger collected until end of user session -> `(08)` Login Details Locate JSON -> `(09)` JSON Populates Contract Dynamically -> `(10)` User lands on Contract page -> `(11)` User Signs Contract -> `(12)` Adds triggered event to collection during flow -> `(13)` User lands on invoice PDF -> `(14)` User downloads docs or just acknowledges them -> `(14)` Adds triggered event to collection during flow -> `(15)` Next page load starts with Stripe API call to create checkout session -> `(16)` User lands on initialized Payment_1 checkout Stripe component -> `(17)` User makes successful payment -> `(18)` Adds triggered event to collection during flow -> `(19)` User lands on return_url for payment_1 -> `(20)` User leaves site and all events are written to JSON -> **CLIENT COMPLETED FIRST PAYMENT, RETURNS LATER TO MAKE SECOND PAYMENT** --> `(21)` User returns when notified to make final payment -> `(22)` Client login -> `(23)` Login Details Locate JSON -> `(24)` JSON referenced to see what state.client_status is next -> `(25)` User lands on balance PDF document -> `(26)` User downloads docs or just acknowledges them -> `(27)` Adds triggered event to collection during flow -> `(28)` Next page load starts with Stripe API call to create checkout session -> `(29)` User lands on initialized Payment_2 checkout Stripe component -> `(30)` User makes successful payment -> `(31)` Adds triggered event to collection during flow -> `(32)` User lands on return_url for payment_2 with links for final access to download any PDF -> `(33)` User leaves site and all events are written to JSON -> **CLIENT COMPLETED PROJECT PAYMENTS AND FLOW**

### Current Job JSON Schema 

  * **BLANK VERSION** TO BE COPIED TO `assets/jobs/...` 
    WHEN CREATING A NEW JOB 
    `assets/docs/uid-xxx-xxx.json` 

  * **GUIDE VERSION** TO USE WHEN FILLING OUT A NEW JOB JSON 
    IT DEFINES THE FORMAT OF EACH VALUE, WHAT IS REQUIRED, AND WHAT IS PROVIDED 
    `assets/docs/GUIDE_uid-xxx-xxx.json.md`

## JSON Files 

### No Admin JSON File Updates 

  + Only add new JSON files 
    - JSON file updates come only from automations 
    - Mistakes mean delete the JSON and create new file with new UID 
  + Fill out new JSON files completely 
    - Create uid-xxx-xxx for product.id 
    - Change "uid" to represent what the id of other objects and pdf are 
    - Coupon = cou-xxx-xxx 
    - Customer = cus-xxx-xxx 
    - Price **is only one created by Stripe and added to JSON after by automation**
    - Contract = kon-xxx-xxx 
    - Invoice = inv-xxx-xxx 
    - Balance = bal-xxx-xxx 

### All Necessary Data Accounted For 

  **Both Stripe objects and PDFs are created on `admin-push.yml` workflow** 

  + JSON values have everything needed to create all Stripe Objects 
  + Values have all required to create Contract, Invoice, Balance PDFs from Templates 
  + Artifacts, IDs and other updates to the JSON files follow creation of Objects and PDFs 

### PDFs Created  

  **Three PDFs Needed Per Job** 

  1. We need our official freelance independent contractor agreement contract PDF; `kon-{job_id}.pdf`
  2. Then because all jobs currently have two payments, the invoice PDF for payment_1 is created; `inv-{job_id}.pdf`
  3. The final payment invoice is called the balance PDF for payment_2; `bal-{job_id}.pdf`

  **PDF generation flow details** 
  
  + Google Docs template-based PDF generation 
    - All placeholders are already mapped to JSON file mapped values 
    - PDF templates have their file ID saved in the environment variables
  + PDFs generated immediately with new JSON job files 
    - PDFs stored only in repository with temporary Google Docs deleted 
    - OAuth refresh token flow is used, not a service account 

---

## User Flow 

  + Events identify where to place user if they leave and return 
  + Events are collected, once each, during user-interaction and then added to JSON upon their session end 

### ISO Timestamp Values In JSON Schema 

  + Each value would receive an ISO timestamp when triggered or when collected events are dispatched 

```json 
    "state": {
        "client_status": {
            "logged_in": null,
            "contract_signed": null,
            "invoice": null,
            "payment_1": null,
            "balance": null,
            "payment_2": null
        }
    }
```

### Event, Meaning, Next Step, Required Action 

  + Meaning of layout below 

  1. `tracked event` = MEANING OF TRACKED EVENT
    --> where user goes next automatically after padding ONLY ACTION STEP GATE BUTTON ON PAGE 

  + User automatically moves to next phase when action gate step is completed 
  + Each event is only triggered and counted once 

  1. `state.client_status.logged_in` = USER LOGGED IN THE FIRST TIME 
    --> continues to contract automatically 
  2. `state.client_status.contract_signed` = USER SIGNED CONTRACT PDF 
    --> continues to invoice automatically after action gate for SIGNING  
  3. `state.client_status.invoice` = USER DOWNLOADED OR ACKNOWLEDGED INVOICE PDF 
    --> continues to payment 1 automatically after action gate for DOWNLOAD DOCS OR ACKNOWLEDGE AND MOVE ON 
  4. `state.client_status.payment_1` = USER PAYMENT 1 CHECKOUT SESSION IS SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED 
    --> continues to `checkout_session_1.return_url= https://dev.payments.august.style/uid-cat-202#completion-1` automatically on payment completion 
    --> URL shows small buttons to continue to balance and final payment 
  5. `state.client_status.balance` = USER DOWNLOADED OR ACKNOWLEDGED BALANCE PDF 
    --> continues to payment 2 automatically after action gate for DOWNLOAD DOCS OR ACKNOWLEDGE AND MOVE ON 
  6. `state.client_status.payment_2` = USER PAYMENT 2 CHECKOUT SESSION IS SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED 
    --> continues to `checkout_session_2.return_url= https://dev.payments.august.style/uid-cat-202#completion-2` automatically on payment completion 
    --> URL shows clear buttons to download previous PDFs and no other page is ever loaded

## Testing Checklist 

- [X] Archive workflow (delete JSON → archive Stripe product)
- [X] Payment flow (contract → invoice → checkout → payment) 
- [X] Multi-payment jobs (Payment 1 → Payment 2 → archive) 
- [X] Manifest updates correctly
- [X] PDF generation works
- [X] Event tracking accurate 
- [X] Completion page messaging correct 
- [X] Git smart-push workflow handles conflicts properly

  + If testing the backend production of objects, PDFs, and adding of artifacts back to the JSON
    - Make bug fix in directory files 
    - Delete the previous Job JSON used in testing 
    - Create a new job JSON to test these items and the bug patch 
  + If testing the frontend user flow and payments process
    - Make bug fix in directory files 
    - Use the same job JSON testing frontend live 
    - Only need a new job JSON if you are fixing bugs in the event tracking triggers recorded

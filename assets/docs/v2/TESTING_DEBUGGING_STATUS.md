# Testing & Debugging Status

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-21  
**Current Phase:** Step 2 - Stripe Catalog Sync Debugging

## ✅ Completed Steps

### Step 1: Manifest Generation - SUCCESS
- ✅ Manifest generated correctly at `assets/js/manifest.json`
- ✅ Contains test job: `testclient-test-single` → `assets/jobs/test-single-payment-v2.json`
- ✅ Accessible on live site: `https://dev.payments.august.style/assets/js/manifest.json`
- ✅ Fixed path issue: `generate_manifest.py` now uses absolute paths from project root

**Key Fixes:**
- Fixed `run_script()` to handle scripts that don't output JSON (like `generate_manifest.py`)
- Fixed `generate_manifest.py` to use absolute paths (`project_root = script_dir.parent.parent`)

## 🔍 Current Issue: Stripe Catalog Sync

### Problem
- Workflow runs `sync_catalog` successfully (no errors reported)
- But JSON files still have:
  - `product.sync: true` (should be `false` after sync)
  - `product.stripe_product_id: null` (should have Stripe product ID)
  - `price[].sync: true` (should be `false` after sync)
  - `price[].stripe_price_id: null` (should have Stripe price ID)

### Observations
1. Recent workflow runs didn't trigger "Auto-update: Manifest and Stripe catalog sync" commit
   - This suggests `sync_catalog` isn't detecting changes or isn't saving them
2. Workflow shows `sync_catalog` in `steps_run` but no stats output visible
3. Stripe library is installed correctly in GitHub Actions
4. `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is set in GitHub Secrets

### Debugging Strategy

#### 1. Check if sync_catalog is actually creating products
- Review workflow logs for Stripe API responses
- Check if `sync_job()` is being called
- Verify error handling isn't swallowing failures
- **FIXED**: Added debug logging to orchestrator to detect when sync_catalog returns empty stats

#### 2. Check if JSON is being saved after Stripe updates
- `sync_catalog.py` calls `save_job()` after syncing
- **FIXED**: `save_job()` wasn't receiving `jobs_dir` parameter - fixed in `sync_catalog.py` line 235
- Verify `save_job()` is working correctly
- Check if changes are being detected by git

#### 3. Check if sync flags are being set correctly
- `detect_sync_needs.py` should set `sync: true` for new/changed items
- Verify this is happening correctly

#### 4. Clean test case needed
- ✅ Created test JSON: `test-single-payment-v2.json` with `sync: true`
- ✅ Pushed and watched workflow
- ⚠️ Workflow runs `sync_catalog` but no products created
- ⚠️ JSON still shows `sync: true` and `stripe_product_id: null`
- **Next**: Check workflow logs for sync_catalog stats output

## 📋 Next Steps

### Immediate: Debug Stripe Sync
1. Review `sync_catalog.py` error handling
2. Check if Stripe API calls are actually succeeding
3. Verify `save_job()` is updating JSON files correctly
4. Create clean test case and monitor workflow logs

### Step 3: Frontend Testing
- Test payment lookup form
- Verify routing logic (`payment-router.js`)
- Test contract display (`contract-controller.js`)
- Test invoice display (`invoice-controller.js`)
- Test checkout flow (`checkout-controller.js`)

### Step 4: Contract Signing Flow
- Test contract signing API endpoint
- Verify workflow dispatch triggers correctly
- Check JSON updates after signing

### Step 5: Payment Flow
- Test Stripe Payment Element integration
- Verify webhook handling
- Check payment status updates

## 📝 Workflow Flow

```
Push to freelance-payments branch
  ↓
orchestrate.yml triggers
  ↓
orchestrate_workflow.py runs:
  1. detect_sync_needs.py (sets sync flags)
  2. sync_catalog.py (creates/updates Stripe products/prices)
  3. generate_manifest.py (creates manifest.json)
  4. git commit & push (single commit)
```

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Stripe sync not updating JSON** - Current focus
2. **Browser testing tools had element interaction issues** - May need manual testing
3. **Manifest path was wrong initially** - Fixed (was `.github/assets/js/`, now `assets/js/`)

## 📊 Test Data

**Test Job:** `test-single-payment-v2.json`
- Client: TestClient
- Project: test-single
- Lookup Key: `testclient-test-single`
- Single payment: $500.00
- `sync: true` for both product and price

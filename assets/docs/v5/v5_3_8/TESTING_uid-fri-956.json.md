## Conclusions 

### Results 

  + ✅ Testing went smoothly with no errors on the User end 
  + ❌ Events were still in two batches, two deployments, two workflows, two commits 

### Observations From Comparing Logs 

- ❌ The events were still separated into two batches 
- ✅ Vercel shows the deployments in correct order, links to correct commits, shows file updates in correct order 
- ❌ GitHub Actions workflows are backwards, linked to incorrect commits which show file update to manifest timestamp
- ✅ The commits show in the actual workflow of the two batches appear to be accurate  
- ✅ Repository Commit log is accurate and links to proper file updates matching Vercel 

### Thoughts 

- The inaccurate matching of Commits to Events didn't cause issue this time, but it makes me think this is the kind of thing that happened in the previous bug. 
- I suspect and am hoping that the reason this flow was successful was because of the changes to the Git command used in the workflow. If we could confirm this, it should mean that we won't run into the previous bug's conflict again. 

### Can We Answer Any of the Following Questions?

  1. Why the commits linked in the GitHub Actions are incorrect? 
    - Is this cause for concern? 
  3. Why the events are still in two batches? 
    - Does it change anything to know that getting them to one batch has *apparently* been a struggle for many agents in many bug patches? 
    - Is it a cause for concern or are the following questions enough to potentially clear any concern? 
  4. Does the updated git command eliminate need to worry about conflicts from these multiple batches? 
  5. Given the logic of the process flow shown at line 222 of `assets/docs/v5/v5_2_0/testing/BUG_03_009.md`, should we be okay with just simplified git commands? 
    - If so should we update the `admin-push.yml` workflow's git command? 
    - And review for possible updates to the "git smart-push" command that we use: `.gitconfig-smart-push.sh`? 
  6. The core of the issue was that the dist copy of the JSON file was not updated accurately, most recently in a bug where it had a copy of the JSON in a state that none of our logs showed being created. 
    - Knowing that the core issue is rather simple, is there a way to create better visibility into the JSON files being updated in dist after building and deploying? 
    - If so, does that mean there would be a method to create a validation check before workflow runs proceed or after they complete? 
    - In general, are there other ways to think about solutions considering we know this core cause, but are foggy on reliability of it always being accurate? 

* **Given the answers to those questions and the results of this testing, what would you advise?**

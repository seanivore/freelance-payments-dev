# Architecture & Modular Workflow Refactor

## Executive Summary

  - A **reusable payment micro-site** for collecting freelance project payments. Clients visit, enter their last name + project keyword, view/sign contracts, view invoices, and pay via Stripe.

  - **Key Innovation:** HTML-first documents with on-demand PDF generation (browser print-to-PDF) - simpler, faster, better UX than pre-generating PDFs.

### Refactoring During Final Testing 

  * **Transform the monolithic automation system into a highly modular, self-documenting architecture where** 

    - Each Stripe API call = one Python script
    - Git-based conditionals → Explicit `sync` flags
    - Redundant data eliminated
    - Mirrors Stripe's object model (use their vocabulary)
    - File structure reveals the logic

  * **Goal:** "If I can understand the Python, I know it's simple enough."

### About the Refactoring Updates  

  * **Debugging revealed opportunity to optimize automation flow** 

  + Needed to see the entire picture 
    - Know the trigger (or triggers)
    - Know the actions 
  + Plan the flow logic with conditionality build into the design 
    - Find more stable solutions 
    - Accommodate shortcoming; find simplest, most effective methods 

  * **Changes made will be highlighted as we go through this document** 

  + Current build will need updates 
    - To fit out improvements 
    - Then we can start testing from start again 
  + Changes to expect, generally  
    - Went fully modular with the API scripts 
    - We better grouped and simplified the JSON object 

  * **The nature of creating this document will result in something comprehensive** 

  + We'll be covering how things did work 
  + And then trying to highlight how things should work

## The Core Architecture

  - **JSON-based** (like portfolio `august.style`)
  - **GitHub Pages** for frontend hosting
  - **Vercel** for serverless API functions
  - **GitHub Actions** for automation (Stripe catalog sync, manifest generation)
  - **Stripe Payment Element** for embedded checkout

### How It Works

  1. **You create** a JSON file per client project in `assets/jobs/`
  2. **GitHub Actions** processes JSON → Creates Stripe products, generates manifest
  3. **Client visits** `payments.august.style` → Enters last name + keyword
  4. **State machine** routes them: Contract → Invoice → Checkout → Completion
  5. **Stripe webhook** updates JSON when payment succeeds

### Two Different Hosts, Two Different Purposes 

  1. GitHub Pages (`payments.august.style`) - FRONTEND
  **What it hosts:**
    - All your HTML files (`index.html`, `contract.html`, `invoice.html`, `checkout.html`)
    - All your JavaScript (`assets/js/*.js`)
    - All your CSS (`assets/css/styles.css`)
    - All your static assets (images, fonts, etc.)

  **What users see:**
    - Users visit `payments.august.style`
    - They see the lookup form, contract, invoice, checkout page
    - This is the **public-facing website**

  2. Vercel (`freelance-payments-neon.vercel.app`) - BACKEND API
  **What it hosts:**
    - Serverless functions in `api/` directory:
    - `/api/create-payment-intent` - Creates Stripe PaymentIntent
    - `/api/sign-contract` - Updates contract signed status
    - `/api/update-payment` - Updates payment status
    - `/api/webhook` - Receives Stripe webhooks

  **What it does:**
    - Handles secure operations (can't expose Stripe secret keys)
    - Processes payments
    - Updates JSON files via GitHub Actions
    - Receives webhooks from Stripe

### How Hosts Work Together 

```
User visits: payments.august.style
     ↓
Frontend (GitHub Pages) loads HTML/JS
     ↓
User fills out lookup form that matches Job JSON file 
     ↓
404-Redirect Dynamically Creates Contract & Invoice from JSON Jobs 
     ↓
Frontend call: freelance-payments-neon.vercel.app/api/ for viewed contract, signed, downloaded 
     ↓
Payment screen triggers frontend call: freelance-payments-neon.vercel.app/api/create-payment-intent
     ↓
Vercel function creates PaymentIntent & returns client_secret to frontend
     ↓
Frontend shows Stripe Payment Element from JSON provided stripe_price_id
     ↓
User completes payment 
     ↓
Stripe sends webhook to: freelance-payments-neon.vercel.app/api/webhook
     ↓
Vercel function updates JSON via GitHub Actions 
```
### Hosts Summary 

  * **FRONTEND:** GitHub Pages Host
    - URL `payments.august.style` 
    - Purpose is what users see and interact with
  * **BACKEND API:** Vercel Host & Stripe API 
    - URL `freelance-payments-neon.vercel.app` 
    - Purpose is handles secure operations, payments 
  * **WEBHOOK:** Vercel host 
    - URL `freelance-payments-neon.vercel.app/api/webhook`
    - Purpose is receives Stripe events

### Setup & Infrastructure 

  - **Tailwind CSS v3** configured with shadcn/ui component styles
  - **Build process** (`npm run build:css`) - CSS compiles from `input.css` → `styles.css`
  - **Portfolio-inspired color scheme** - Dark theme with gradient depth effect and cereal aesthetic colors
  - **Component library** - Button, Input, Card components ready

---

## Items To Fix Post Refactor 

### Core Pages 

  1. **Lookup Page** (`index.html`)
    - shadcn/ui-styled form; Last Name + Project Keyword inputs
    - Error handling; Redirects to payment router

  2. **Payment Router** (`payment-router.html` + `payment-router.js`)
    - State machine logic
    - Routes based on contract signing and payment status
    - Handles: contract → invoice → checkout → completion

  3. **Contract Page** (`contract.html` + `contract-controller.js`)
    - Dynamically populates from JSON
    - Signature fields (typed name + date)
    - Sign button updates sessionStorage
    - Download PDF button (browser print-to-PDF)
    - Navigation links

  4. **Invoice Page** (`invoice.html` + `invoice-controller.js`)
    - Shows specific payment details
    - Payment number, amount, due date/term, status
    - Download PDF button
    - Links to contract/checkout

  5. **Checkout Page** (`checkout.html` + `checkout-controller.js`)
    - Stripe Payment Element integration (ready)
    - Payment form with error handling
    - Success handling (updates sessionStorage)
    - Routes to next payment or completion

  6. **Completion Page** (`completion.html`)
    - Success message for completed payments
    - Contact information

### JavaScript Controllers

  * **`assets/js/payment-lookup.js`** 
    - Lookup form handler, loads manifest, finds JSON
  * **`assets/js/payment-router.js`** 
    - State machine routing logic
  * **`assets/js/contract-controller.js`** 
    - Contract page controller, signature handling
  * **`assets/js/invoice-controller.js`**  
    - Invoice page controller
  * **`assets/js/checkout-controller.js`**  
    - Stripe Payment Element integration

### Data Files

  * **`assets/jobs/*.json`** 
    - One JSON file per client project (see `_job_template.json`)
  * **`assets/js/manifest.json`**  
    - Lookup mapping: `{last_name}-{project_keyword}` → JSON path
  * **`generate_manifest.py`** 
    - Script that generates manifest.json
  * **`.github/workflows/process-job.yml`**
    - Previous COMBINED workflow: Generates manifest & stripe catalog 
  * **`.github/scripts/process_stripe_products.py`** 
    - Stripe catalog sync script

### Automation

  * **`api/*.js`** 
    - Vercel serverless functions

### Templates

  * **`assets/templates/contract-template.html`** 
    - Contract HTML template
  * **`assets/templates/invoice-template.html`** 
    - Invoice HTML template
  * **`assets/jobs/_job_template.json`** 
    - JSON schema template

### Styling

  * **`assets/css/input.css`** 
    - Tailwind CSS source (with custom variables)
  * **`assets/css/styles.css`** 
    - Built CSS (committed to git)
  * **`tailwind.config.js`** 
    - Tailwind configuration
  * **`package.json`** 
    - npm scripts: `build:css`, `watch:css`

### Documentation

## AI Context Primer Common Pitfalls

### DO NOT "Fix" These Things

  1. **Glob Pattern**
    ```yaml
    paths:
      - "assets/jobs/*.json"  # ← Correct (files directly in folder)
    NOT: "assets/jobs/**/*.json"  # ← Wrong (looks for subdirectories)
    ```

  2. **Manifest Path**
    ```python
    output_file = Path('assets/js/manifest.json')  # ← Correct
    NOT: Path('manifest.json')  # ← Wrong
    ```

  3. **Stripe Constructor**
    ```javascript
    stripe = Stripe(publishableKey);  # ← Correct (capital S - constructor function)
    NOT: stripe = stripe(publishableKey);  # ← Wrong (lowercase - would be undefined)
    ```
    **Note**: Some IDEs may suggest lowercase, but `Stripe` (capital S) is the correct constructor function from Stripe.js library.

  4. **Stripe Amount Conversion**
    ```python
    amount_cents = int(round(amount * 100))  # ← Correct (dollars → cents)
    NOT: amount_cents = amount  # ← Wrong
    ```

  5. **Date Formats**
    ```json
    "due_date": "2025-01-20",           // ← ISO format (human-readable)
    "due_date_unix": 1737417600         // ← Unix timestamp (API-ready)
    ```

### Architecture-Specific Notes

  - **Frontend calls Vercel API** - Not same domain, use full URL
  - **Manifest updates automatically** - Don't manually edit `manifest.json`
  - **Stripe products = separate per payment** - Format: `{invoice_number}-{payment_number}`
  - **Deletion compares folder vs catalog** - Self-healing, works anytime
  - **Workflow runs on JSON changes** - Not on other file changes

### Important Reminders

  - **CSS must be built**: Run `npm run build:css` before committing
  - **Python uses python3**: Scripts use `python3`, not `python`
  - **Branch name**: `freelance-payments` (matches workflow)
  - **Test files**: In `assets/docs/W_I_P/` (not in `assets/jobs/`)
  - **Stripe constructor**: Use `Stripe()` (capital S) - it's a constructor function, not a variable

### Git Auto-Pull Before Push

  To automatically pull before pushing (like portfolio project):

  **Option 1: Git config (recommended)**
  ```bash
  git config pull.rebase true
  git config push.autoSetupRemote true
  ```

  Then `git push` will automatically rebase local changes on top of remote changes.

### Key Debugging Resources

  - **GitHub Actions**: https://github.com/seanivore/freelance-payments/actions
  - **Stripe Dashboard**: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products
  - **Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/seanivores-projects/freelance-payments
  - **Vercel Logs**: `vercel logs` (CLI) or Dashboard → Functions → Logs

## Design UI & UX Flow, Interrupted

### Homepage `index.html` 

  + Client login using their last name and a provided key-phrase 
  + Add a visual effect that stays with the pointer 
    - Create a bright glow behind colored frosted glass 
    - Light from glow reflects and shines around the corners of design elements 

  + Current screenshot 
    `assets/docs/planning-resources/homepage-glow-mouse/example-homepage-glow-mouse-1.jpg`
    - Inspo update screenshots; white is where pointer was 
    `assets/docs/planning-resources/homepage-glow-mouse/example-homepage-glow-mouse-2.jpg`
    - Inspo of same inspo site showing reflecting corners of elements 
    `assets/docs/planning-resources/homepage-glow-mouse/example-homepage-glow-mouse-3.jpg`

### Rest of Micro-Site 

  * **Have not tested far enough to see yet**

  1. Login on homepage as described above 
  2. Contract created dynamically from template and client's job JSON file 
  `assets/templates/contract-template.html` 
  3. Invoice created dynamically from job JSON file 
  `assets/templates/invoice-template.html` 
  4. Users scroll through and then can sign and download 
  5. After signing the payment page loads 
    + Calls Stripe API for 'Product' in Catalog's 'Price' 
      - State management from user interactions for smart loading 
      - Knows if you signed or not 
      - If you did, then shows first payment 
      - If you made first payment, shows section, etc. 

### Embrace Portfolio Style but with "Banker Legitimacy" Edge 

  * **Mint is a great example of amazing design for feeling secure** 

  + Portfolio CSS 
  `assets/docs/planning-resources/styles_example.css`

  + Specifically
    - the background with a gradient stripe down the middle to create curved depth 
    - The "cereal aesthetic" with the three horizontal bars that make a triangle 
    `assets/docs/planning-resources/portfolio-aesthetic-example.jpg`
  
  + Homepage can be improved and then carry through rest of pages 

---

## Anatomy Of The Updated Schema 

  * **Filename saved as Job ID** 

  + Use "Unique ID" generator 
    - Script on local system with custom command 
    - Always random result that is never repeated 

```bash 
  > ~/Development/freelance-payments > uid 
  Generated UID: uid-ccl-405
```

  * **Signable contract, invoice, and payment populated dynamically from JSON** 

  + Users login to the payment portal `payments.august.style` 
    - Client's contact last name and provided `project.keyword` 
    - Searches `assets/jobs/**.json` for their project's job JSON  

```json

      5. New or updated product, change `sync` to FALSE 
  Always add or update PRODUCT ENTRY including getting the "stripe_product_id" before creating ANY PRICE OBJECTS for this same product */ 
}
``` 

### Key Simplifications

  1. Use Stripe's Vocabulary
    - `active: true/false` (not custom "archived" state)
    - `sync: true/false` (not "needs_sync")
    - Product and Price objects mirror Stripe's structure

  2. Fix the Product → Prices Issue
    - Before:Each price created its own product (no `product` ID provided)
    - Now: Create Product FIRST → Get `stripe_product_id` → ALL prices reference SAME product

  3. Eliminate Duplication
    - `job_id` vs `invoice_number` (same thing)
    - Metadata in JSON AND Stripe (redundant)
    - Utils that are overkill (`metadata_builder.py`, `product_name_builder.py`)
    - Write `job_id` ONCE at top level (no duplication = no typos!)

  4. Simple Sync Logic

  * **PRODUCT OBJECT SECTION `sync: TRUE` PROCEDURE** 

    1. `sync` = true, then search for matching stripe_product_id 
    2. No matches? CREATE NEW PRODUCT 
    3. Find match? OVERWRITE ALL PRODUCT FIELDS PROVIDED 
    4. New product, place stripe_product_id on JSON 
    5. New or updated product, change `sync` to FALSE 

  * **PRICE OBJECT SECTION `sync: TRUE` PROCEDURE** 

    1. `sync` = true, then search for matching stripe_price_id 
    2. No matches? CREATE NEW PRICE OBJECT  
    3. Find match? CHANGE IT TO ACTIVE:FALSE AND CREATE NEW PRICE OBJECT 
    4. New price, place stripe_price_id on JSON 
    5. New or updated product, change `sync` to FALSE 

  * **CRITICAL: Product FIRST, then Prices!**

  **Product Sync (if `product.sync = true`):**
  ```python
  # Step 1: Check if product exists in Stripe
  if product.stripe_product_id:
      # Step 2: Product exists → Modify it
      call modify_product.py
  else:
      # Step 3: Product doesn't exist → Create it
      result = call create_product.py
      # Store the returned stripe_product_id in JSON
      product.stripe_product_id = result.id

  # Set sync = false (sync complete)
  product.sync = false
  ```

  **Price Sync (if `price.sync = true`):**
  ```python
  # Step 1: Check if price exists in Stripe
  if price.stripe_price_id:
      # Step 2: Price exists → Archive old, create new
      call archive_price.py(old_price_id)
      result = call create_price.py(
          product=product.stripe_product_id,  # CRITICAL!
          unit_amount=price.unit_amount
      )
      price.stripe_price_id = result.id
  else:
      # Step 3: Price doesn't exist → Create it
      result = call create_price.py(
          product=product.stripe_product_id,  # CRITICAL!
          unit_amount=price.unit_amount
      )
      price.stripe_price_id = result.id

  # Set sync = false (sync complete)
  price.sync = false
  ```

**Why this order matters:**
- Product MUST be created FIRST to get `stripe_product_id`
- ALL prices reference the SAME `stripe_product_id` in their `product` field
- This fixes the old bug where each price got its own product

## New Modular Scripts

  1. Created `.github/scripts/stripe/` modules (9 scripts)
  2. Created `.github/scripts/state/` modules (3 scripts)
  3. Created `.github/scripts/utils/` modules (2 scripts)
  4. Created `.github/scripts/orchestration/` modules (2 scripts)

  * **Write unit tests for each module**  -- MUST DO

### Script I/O Contracts

  * **Each script:**

    - Takes CLI args (`--product-id`, `--amount`, etc.)
    - Returns JSON to stdout
    - Uses exit codes (0=success, 1=validation error, 2=API error)
    - Has docstring explaining purpose and usage

  Example:
  ```python
  """
  Create a Stripe Price for a product.

  Usage:
      python3 create_price.py --product-id prod_xxx --amount 125000 --currency usd

  Returns:
      {"price_id": "price_xxx", "amount": 125000, "currency": "usd"}

  Exit codes:

  """
  ```

### Key Scripts

  * **`state/detect_sync_needs.py`** - Replaces git diff logic
    - Compares current JSON to git HEAD
    - If product fields changed → Set `product.sync = true`
    - If price fields changed → Set `prices[n].sync = true`
    - Commits sync JSON with flags

  * **`orchestration/sync_catalog.py`** - Main coordinator (simple 3-step logic)

  * **`orchestration/cleanup_orphans.py`** - Edge case cleanup
    - Lists all products from Stripe
    - Compares to current JSON files (by job_id)
    - Deletes orphaned products (and their prices first!)

### Replace Git-Based Conditionals with Section Flags

  * **OLD (complex):**

  ```python
  # Git diff, complex comparisons, fragile logic
  def should_update_stripe_payment(payment, prev_payment):
      if not payment.get('stripe_product_id'): return True
      if prev_payment is None: return True
      if payment.get('amount') != prev_payment.get('amount'): return True
      # ...more conditionals
  ```

  * **NEW (simple):**

  ```python
  # Just check the sync flags
  def needs_sync(job_data):
      if job_data['product']['sync']:
          return True
      if any(price['sync'] for price in job_data['prices']):
          return True
      return False
  ```

### New Workflow Files

  * **`catalog-sync.yml`** - Syncs Stripe catalog on JSON changes

  ```yaml
  on:
    push:
      branches: [freelance-payments]
      paths: ["assets/jobs/*.json"]

  steps:
    - Detect sync needs (detect_sync_needs.py)
    - Commit state flags
    - Sync catalog (sync_catalog.py)
    - Cleanup orphans (cleanup_orphans.py)
    - Commit Stripe updates
  ```

  * **`user-action.yml`** - Handles contract signing, payment updates

  ```yaml
  on:
    workflow_dispatch:
      inputs: [action, invoice_number, payload]

  steps:
    - If action=sign-contract: update_contract.py
    - If action=update-payment: update_payment.py
    - Commit changes
  ```

  * **`manifest-update.yml`** - Generates manifest separately

  ```yaml
  on:
    push:
      paths: ["assets/jobs/*.json", "generate_manifest.py"]

  steps:
    - Generate manifest
    - Commit if changed
  ```

### Vercel Integration Details 

  * **GitHub Pages:** Static hosting only
    - Can only serve HTML/CSS/JS files
    - Cannot run server-side code
    - Cannot store secret keys

  * **Vercel:** Stateless serverless functions (backend API)
    - Creates Stripe Payment Intents (needs `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - already configured!)
    - Validates Stripe webhooks (signature verification - already set up!)
    - Triggers GitHub Actions (needs auth)
    - Bridges static frontend → dynamic backend

### Vercel Already Has

  - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` configured
  - Webhook set up (payment.succeeded, payment_intent events)
  - Connected to GitHub

### What Vercel Handles

  * **Contract Signing Flow:**
    - User signs → Frontend calls `/api/sign-contract`
    - Vercel triggers GitHub Actions → update_contract.py
    - Updates `contract.signed` and signature fields

  * **Payment Routing Logic:**
    - Already handles: "signed but not paid → route to payment 1"
    - Already handles: "paid payment 1 → route to payment 2"
    - **Verify:** Do we still need this complexity or just check contract.signed?

### Schema & Test JSON 

  1. Need to create new JSON test files with the new schema 
  2. Delete the old 

  * **OLD FOR REFERENCE**
  
    - `assets/docs/W_I_P/test-all-paid.json`
    - `assets/docs/W_I_P/test-already-signed.json`
    - `assets/docs/W_I_P/test-four-payments.json`
    - `assets/docs/W_I_P/test-long-description.json`
    - `assets/docs/W_I_P/test-multi-payment.json`
    - `assets/docs/W_I_P/test-partially-paid.json`
    - `assets/docs/W_I_P/test-single-payment.json`
    - `assets/docs/W_I_P/test-special-chars.json`
  
  * **NEW SCHEMA TEMPLATE** 

    - `assets/jobs/_job_template_v2.json`

## Update Migration Tasks, Continued 

**Frontend Updates:**
- `checkout-controller.js`: `stripe_price_id` → `stripe.current_price_id`
- Contract: Update signature paths

**Validation:** Old and new JSON produce identical frontend renders

### Orchestration Integration

Build new orchestrators using modular scripts:

**Tasks:**
1. Implement `detect_sync_needs.py`
2. Implement `sync_catalog.py` (calls modular Stripe scripts)
3. Implement `cleanup_orphans.py` (calls modular Stripe scripts)
4. Test on test data
5. Compare to old system output

**Validation:** New orchestration produces identical Stripe API calls as old

### Workflow Cutover

Replace monolithic workflow with modular workflows:

**Tasks:**
1. Create new workflows (catalog-sync.yml, user-action.yml, manifest-update.yml)
2. Disable old workflow (rename to .old)
3. Enable new workflows
4. Monitor first runs
5. Archive old scripts

**Rollback:** Keep old workflow available, can re-enable instantly

## Critical Files for Implementation 

  * **The 5 most important files:**

  1. **`state/detect_sync_needs.py`**
    - Core logic replacing git diff
    - Sets state flags that drive everything

  2. **`orchestration/sync_catalog.py`**
    - Main coordinator replacing process_stripe_products.py
    - Orchestrates all Stripe operations

  3. **`utils/json_io.py`**
    - All scripts depend on this
    - Must handle new schema correctly

  4. **`workflows/catalog-sync.yml`**
    - Primary workflow replacing process-job.yml
    - Coordinates detection → sync → commit

  5. **`migration/migrate_schema.py`**
    - One-time migration to new schema
    - Critical for smooth transition

| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Contract opened    | `contract.viewed = true`                                     |                                       |

| Contract signed    | `contract.signed = true`                                     | Vercel → `update_contract.py`         |
| Product added      | `stripe_product_id` add; `sync = false`                    |                                       |
| Product updated    | `sync = false`                                             | `detect_sync_needs` → `sync_catalog`  |
| First payment made | `price.paid = true`; `price.active = false`                           |                                       |
| Only payment made  | `price.paid = true`; `price.active = false`; `product.active = false` | `update_payment.py` checks all prices |
| Second payment made| `price.paid = true`; `price.active = false`                           |                                       |
| Final payment made | `price.paid = true`; `price.active = false`; `product.active = false` | Webhook → `update_payment.py`         |
| Price added        | `stripe_price_id` add; `sync = false`                      | `sync_catalog.py`                     |
| Price updated      | `sync = false`                                             | `detect_sync_needs` → `sync_catalog`  |
| Job JSON Deleted   | First delete product's Price Objects, then delete Product Object      | `cleanup_orphans.py`                  |

### Archive & Delete Stripe Rules 

  1. Must archive or delete all Price Objects related to a product first 
  2. Then you can archive or delete the Product Object

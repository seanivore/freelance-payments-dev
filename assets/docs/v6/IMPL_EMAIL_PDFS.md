# Email PDF Implementation Guide

**Created**: 2026-01-19  
**Updated**: 2026-01-24  
**Status**: Planning Phase  
**Priority**: High (Required for v6)

---

## Executive Summary

This document provides an exclusively executable implementation plan for automated email delivery throughout the payment flow. Emails are triggered by existing events and sent via Gmail API (already have Google OAuth set up).

**Email Types**:
1. **Contract Signed** — Signed PDF to client + freelancer
2. **Invoice Acknowledged** — Invoice PDF to client
3. **Payment 1 Receipt** — Receipt + document links to client
4. **Balance Acknowledged** — Balance PDF to client
5. **Payment 2 Receipt** — Final receipt + all documents attached to client

---

## Current State

### What We Have
- **Google OAuth**: Already configured for Google Docs API (PDF generation)
- **Refresh Token**: Stored in GitHub Secrets (`GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS`)
- **Event System**: All trigger points already exist in `user-exit-events.yml`
- **PDF Files**: Contract, invoice, balance PDFs in `assets/pdf/`
- **Customer Email**: Stored in JSON at `customer.email`

### What We Need
- Add `gmail.send` scope to OAuth
- Create email sending utility
- Create email templates
- Integrate into event processing

---

## Technical Implementation

### Step 1: Add Gmail API Scope

**Action**: Re-authorize Google OAuth with additional scope

The current OAuth setup uses:
```javascript
const SCOPES = [
  'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents',
  'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive',
];
```

Need to add:
```javascript
const SCOPES = [
  'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents',
  'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive',
  'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send',  // NEW
];
```

**File to Update**: `api/google/auth.js`

After updating, you'll need to:
1. Run the OAuth flow again to get a new refresh token
2. Update `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS` in GitHub Secrets

---

### Step 2: Create Email Utility

**New File**: `.github/scripts/utils/email_sender.py`

```python
"""

---

### Step 5: Integrate into User Exit Events

**File**: `.github/scripts/orchestration/user_exit_events.py`

Add email dispatch after processing each event:

```python
# At the top, add import
import sys
sys.path.append('.github/scripts/utils')
from email_dispatcher import dispatch_email_for_event

# After processing each event and updating JSON:
for event in events:
    event_type = event.get('type')
    
    # ... existing event processing code ...
    
    # NEW: Send email for this event
    dispatch_email_for_event(event_type, job_data, job_id)
```

---

### Step 6: Update Workflow Dependencies

**File**: `.github/workflows/user-exit-events.yml`

```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: |
    pip install stripe pypdf reportlab google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib

- name: Process events
  env:
    JOB_ID: ${{ github.event.inputs.job_id }}
    PAYLOAD_JSON: ${{ github.event.inputs.payload_json }}
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY: ${{ secrets.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY }}
    GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS: ${{ secrets.GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS }}
    GMAIL_SENDER_EMAIL: sean@august.style
  run: |
    python .github/scripts/orchestration/user_exit_events.py
```

---

## OAuth Re-authorization

### Steps to Add Gmail Scope

1. **Update `api/google/auth.js`** to include `gmail.send` scope
2. **Run OAuth flow locally**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Visit http://localhost:5173/api/google/auth
   # Complete OAuth consent
   ```
3. **Copy new refresh token** from callback
4. **Update GitHub Secret** `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS` with new token

### Gmail API Consent Screen Notes

- Gmail API requires OAuth consent screen verification for sending to external users
- For low volume (< 100 emails/day), can use "Testing" mode initially
- May need to verify app if sending to many external addresses

---

## Testing Checklist

### Email Sending
- [ ] Gmail API credentials work with new scope
- [ ] `send_email()` successfully sends test email
- [ ] Attachments are included correctly
- [ ] CC works for freelancer copies

### Template Rendering
- [ ] `replace_placeholders()` handles all token types
- [ ] Currency formatting works correctly
- [ ] Missing values don't break templates

### Event Integration
- [ ] `contract_signed` triggers email with signed PDF
- [ ] `invoice` triggers email with invoice PDF
- [ ] `payment_1` triggers receipt email (no attachments)
- [ ] `balance` triggers email with balance PDF
- [ ] `payment_2` triggers email with all PDFs

### Error Handling
- [ ] Missing customer email handled gracefully
- [ ] Missing PDF files don't crash workflow
- [ ] Email failures logged but don't fail workflow

---

## Security Considerations

### Email Address Validation
- Only send to addresses from job JSON (trusted source)
- Log all email sends for audit trail

### Attachment Security

## Next Steps

1. **Update OAuth** — Add `gmail.send` scope, re-authorize
2. **Create utility files** — `email_sender.py`, `email_templates.py`, `email_dispatcher.py`
3. **Update workflow** — Add dependencies and env vars
4. **Integrate** — Add email dispatch to `user_exit_events.py`
5. **Test** — Send test emails, verify attachments
6. **Deploy** — Push changes, monitor email delivery

_This document provides a complete implementation plan for automated email delivery. Emails are sent via Gmail API using existing Google OAuth credentials, triggered by the same events that update JSON state._

# Testing Log 01 - v5 Development

**Created**: 2026-01-17 
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-17 (all fixes implemented)

## Logging Instructions for AI Agents

This log tracks bugs and fixes during v5 testing. Follow these conventions:

- **File Naming**: `LOG_XX.md` where XX is the log number (01, 02, etc.)
- **Bug Numbering**: `BUG_XX_YYY` where XX matches log number, YYY is sequential bug count across all v5 logs
- **When starting a new log**: User will provide the last bug number from previous log (e.g., "Last bug was BUG_01_015")
- **Grouping**: Use larger headers (##) for test job file names to group related bugs
- **Content**: Keep entries concise - include user's essential details, expected behavior, actual behavior, and fixes implemented
- **Additional Details**: Log any relevant technical details, console errors, workflow runs, commit hashes, or related context

## Test Job: `uid-tst-001.json`

### BUG_01_001 - Return URL 404 Redirect Failure

**Date**: 2026-01-17  
**Status**: Open - Fix attempted but still failing

**Issue**: After successful payment, Stripe redirects to `return_url` but gets 404 error. URL format: `https://dev.payments.august.style/uid-tst-001?session_id=cs_test_...`

**Expected**: User should be redirected to completion page showing payment success  
**Actual**: 404 error, fallback "Payment succeeded" page displays instead

**Root Cause**: 
- Vercel rewrites not configured to handle job routes with query parameters
- React `useEffect` checking `session_id` ran before `data` loaded, so session status fetch never executed

**Fixes Attempted** (2026-01-17):
- Added `rewrites` to `vercel.json` to route all non-API routes to `404.html` (preserves query params)
- Split `useEffect` in `src/App.tsx` into two hooks:
  - Effect 1: Detects `session_id` on mount, stores in state
  - Effect 2: Processes session status when both `sessionId` and `data` are available
- Updated `createCheckoutSession` to pass explicit `return_url` with `{CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}` template

**Test Result**: Fix did not resolve issue - still getting 404 after push and build with new test job (`uid-tst-001.json`)

**Files Modified**:
- `vercel.json`: Added rewrites configuration
- `src/App.tsx`: Fixed `useEffect` dependency arrays and session handling

**Console Error**: `GET https://dev.payments.august.style/uid-tst-001?session_id=cs_test_... 404 (Not Found)`

**Fixes Implemented** (2026-01-17):
- Added `cleanUrls: false` to `vercel.json` to preserve query parameters
- Added script comment in `404.html` to document query param preservation
- Added debug logging in `App.tsx` to track `session_id` detection
- Query params should now be preserved through 404.html → React app transition

**Files Modified**:
- `vercel.json`: Added `cleanUrls: false`
- `404.html`: Added documentation script
- `src/App.tsx`: Added debug logging for session_id detection

**Next Steps**: Test with new job to verify rewrites work correctly

### BUG_01_002 - Stripe Custom UI Shows $0.00 Instead of Correct Amount

**Date**: 2026-01-17  
**Status**: Open

**Issue**: Stripe Payment Element displays $0.00 in two locations:
1. Above payment form (invoice total area)
2. On payment button ("Pay $0.00 now")

**Expected**: Should show calculated amount: `price1.unit_amount - coupon.amount_off` (e.g., $4,500.00)  
**Actual**: Both locations show $0.00

**Context**: 
- Payment actually processes correctly ($4,500.00 charged successfully)
- Previously showed "$NaN" on button, fixed to show $0.00 (but still incorrect)
- At least one test in the past showed correct amount

**Stripe Events** (from successful payment):
- `payment_intent.created` for USD 4,500.00
- `charge.succeeded` for USD 4,500.00
- `payment_intent.succeeded` for USD 4,500.00
- `checkout.session.completed` - Webhook sent 200

**Investigation Notes**:
- `CheckoutForm.tsx` has fallback logic to fetch from session-status API if totals missing
- May be related to Stripe Elements loading before session details are available
- Checkout session created correctly (payment processes), so issue is display-only

**Fixes Implemented** (2026-01-17):
- Added `price` and `coupon` props to `CheckoutForm` component
- Implemented multi-strategy fallback:
  1. Use checkout session total if available
  2. Fetch from session-status API if total is 0
  3. Calculate from price data (`price.unit_amount - coupon.amount_off`) as immediate fallback
- Added comprehensive debug logging to track amount resolution
- `PaymentView` now passes price/coupon data to `CheckoutForm`

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/CheckoutForm.tsx`: Added props, improved fallback logic, added calculated amount fallback
- `src/components/PaymentView.tsx`: Pass price and coupon data to CheckoutForm
- `api/create-checkout-session.js`: Verified line items are created correctly (already correct)

**Expected Result**: Checkout form shows correct calculated amount immediately, with fallback to session-status API if needed

### BUG_01_003 - User Exit Events Workflow Runs Twice, Creates Conflicts

**Date**: 2026-01-17  
**Status**: Open

**Issue**: `user-exit-events.yml` workflow triggered twice for same session, creating conflicting commits:
1. Commit `bc2832e`: Updates `contract.signatures.client` and `state.client_status` (many redundant edits)
2. Commit `1bd6d3d`: Updates `price1.active` from `true` to `false`, but expects previous fields to be empty (causes conflicts)

**Expected**: Single workflow run that updates all fields atomically  
**Actual**: Two sequential workflow runs with conflicting edits

**Observations**:
- First commit (`bc2832e`) not shown in GitHub Actions list (only second one visible)
- Second workflow failed with JSON parse error: "Expecting property name enclosed in double quotes: line 15 column 1"
- Both commits show "bot" as author (Vercel builds)
- Line 15 is customer name field (updated during contract signing)

**Root Cause Hypothesis**:
- Multiple triggers: Webhook event + user-exit event both triggering workflow
- Race condition: First workflow commits, second workflow starts before first completes
- JSON corruption: Second workflow reads file while first is writing, gets malformed JSON

**Files Modified** (by workflows):
- `assets/jobs/uid-tst-001.json`: Conflicting edits to `contract.signatures.client`, `state.client_status`, `price1.active`

**GitHub Actions Log Error**:
```
Error reading job file: Expecting property name enclosed in double quotes: line 15 column 1 (char 453)
```

**Fixes Implemented** (2026-01-17):
- Removed duplicate `trackEvent('payment_1')` and `trackEvent('payment_2')` calls from `App.tsx` session completion handler
- Webhook is now single source of truth for payment events
- Updated concurrency to `cancel-in-progress: true` with job-level grouping: `user-events-${{ github.event.inputs.job_id }}`
- Added deduplication checks in `user_exit_events.py` to skip payment events if already processed

**Files Modified**:
- `src/App.tsx`: Removed payment event tracking (webhook handles it)
- `.github/workflows/user-exit-events.yml`: Updated concurrency settings
- `.github/scripts/orchestration/user_exit_events.py`: Added deduplication for payment_1 and payment_2 events

**Expected Result**: Only one workflow run per payment, no conflicts

### BUG_01_004 - PDF Generation Type Error: String/Int Arithmetic

**Date**: 2026-01-17  
**Status**: Fixed

**Issue**: PDF generation fails with error: `unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'int'` when generating contract, invoice, and balance PDFs.

**Root Cause**: JSON values for `unit_amount` and `amount_off` are sometimes stored as strings instead of integers. Arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`) fail when mixing string and int types.

**Fixes Implemented**:
- Added `safe_int()` helper function to convert string/int/None values to integers safely
- Updated all calculation functions to use `safe_int()`:
  - `calculate_amount_due()`: Converts `unit_amount` values
  - `calculate_subtotal()`: Converts both price amounts
  - `calculate_payment_due()`: Converts `unit_amount` and `amount_off`
  - `generate_invoice_pdf()`: Converts all price/coupon values before arithmetic

**Files Modified**:
- `.github/scripts/orchestration/admin_push.py`: Added `safe_int()` helper and updated all calculation functions

**Test Job**: `uid-tst-002.json`

### BUG_01_005 - Stripe Object Creation Fails When Coupon Already Exists

**Date**: 2026-01-17  
**Status**: Fixed

**Issue**: When creating Stripe objects for new job `uid-tst-003`, creation failed with error: "Coupon already exists" for `cou-tst-003`. This caused:
- No Stripe objects created (products_created: 0)
- No PDFs generated (skipped because no new products)
- Manifest updated correctly
- Orphaned product archived correctly

**Root Cause**: `create_stripe_coupon()` function doesn't check if coupon already exists before attempting creation. Unlike `create_stripe_product()` which has error handling, coupon creation fails immediately if ID already exists. When coupon creation throws an exception:
- Exception prevents `create_stripe_objects_for_job()` from returning stats
- Even though product WAS created (happens before coupon), `products_created` stays 0
- PDF generation checks `if products_created > 0`, so it skips
- Manifest update happens regardless (reads JSON files directly)

**Fixes Implemented**:
- Added `check_stripe_coupon_exists()` helper function to check if coupon exists
- Updated `create_stripe_coupon()` to check for existing coupon before creation
- If coupon exists, return existing coupon ID instead of failing
- Added try/except around coupon creation in `create_stripe_objects_for_job()` to make it non-blocking
- Added fallback check in outer exception handler: if product exists in Stripe but stats weren't returned, count it for PDF generation

**Files Modified**:
- `.github/scripts/orchestration/admin_push.py`: 
  - Added `check_stripe_coupon_exists()` helper
  - Made coupon creation non-blocking with try/except
  - Added fallback logic to detect partially created jobs

## Test Job: `uid-ngq-236.json`

### BUG_01_009 - Return URL Redirects to Contract Instead of Completion Page

**Date**: 2026-01-17  
**Status**: Fixed

**Issue**: After successful payment, Stripe redirects to `return_url` with `session_id`, but the app routes back to contract instead of showing the completion page. This happens because the state management checks `data.state.client_status.payment_1` which is still `null` (workflow hasn't run yet to update the JSON file).

**Expected**: User should see completion1 page immediately after payment, even before workflow updates JSON  
**Actual**: App routes to contract page because `payment_1` is null in JSON

**Root Cause**: 
- Routing logic (`initialSection`) runs synchronously based on `data.state.client_status`
- Optimistic update happens asynchronously in `useEffect` (Effect 2)
- When `sessionId` is detected, routing logic doesn't account for the fact that payment just completed

**Console Log**:
```
Detected session_id: cs_test_a1pcTH9gIc6Pa2hNZNIzR47djNDgMWQJ0fhp1FPFNhB63pYcoHn7EzsWgo (from URL)
Event: contract_loaded
```

**Fixes Implemented** (2026-01-17):
- Updated routing logic in `src/App.tsx` to check for `sessionId` first
- If `sessionId` exists AND `invoice` viewed but `payment_1` not recorded → route to `completion1`
- If `sessionId` exists AND `balance` viewed but `payment_2` not recorded → route to `completion2`
- Added logging to track routing decisions
- Improved Effect 2 logging to show when optimistic updates are applied

**Files Modified**:
- `src/App.tsx`: Updated `initialSection` calculation to account for `sessionId` and payment completion state

**Expected Result**: Return URL should immediately show completion page, even before workflow updates JSON

### BUG_01_010 - User Exit Events Workflow Runs Multiple Times, Fails to Process Payment

**Date**: 2026-01-17  
**Status**: Fixed

**Issue**: Workflow attempted to run 3 times for same payment event:
1. **First workflow (#27)**: Cancelled due to `cancel-in-progress: true` setting
2. **Second workflow (#28)**: Failed with merge conflict during git operations
3. **Third workflow (#29)**: Succeeded but reported "No state changes required" - payment_1 was NOT updated

**Expected**: Single workflow run that processes payment_1 event and updates JSON  
**Actual**: Three workflow runs, payment_1 left as `null`, `price1.active` left as `true`

**Root Cause**:
- `cancel-in-progress: true` cancels first workflow when second is queued
- Git operations (`git pull --no-rebase`) cause merge conflicts when multiple workflows run
- Third workflow reads file with conflicts, can't process properly, reports "No changes"

**GitHub Actions Logs**:
- Workflow #27: Cancelled - "Canceling since a higher priority waiting request for user-events-uid-ngq-236 exists"
- Workflow #28: Failed - Merge conflict in `assets/jobs/uid-ngq-236.json`, rebase failed
- Workflow #29: Succeeded - "No state changes required" but payment_1 was never updated

**Actual Result in JSON**:
- `payment_1`: `null` (should be timestamp)
- `price1.active`: `true` (should be `false`)

**Fixes Implemented** (2026-01-17):
- Changed concurrency from `cancel-in-progress: true` to `cancel-in-progress: false` to queue workflows sequentially instead of canceling
- Improved git operations in workflow:
  - Fetch latest before committing
  - Use merge (not rebase) to preserve commit history
  - If merge conflict detected, reset to remote and re-run Python script with latest file state
  - Store `PAYLOAD_JSON` in temp file for re-processing after reset
- Enhanced Python script to detect Git merge conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)
- Exit with code 2 if merge conflict detected, workflow handles by resetting and re-processing

**Files Modified**:
- `.github/workflows/user-exit-events.yml`: Changed concurrency, improved git operations, added conflict resolution
- `.github/scripts/orchestration/user_exit_events.py`: Added merge conflict detection

**Expected Result**: Workflows queue sequentially, git operations handle conflicts gracefully, payment_1 is always recorded

### BUG_01_011 - State Management Ignores All Timestamps on Second Login

**Date**: 2026-01-17  
**Status**: Fixed

**Issue**: User logged in again after payment_1 (even though it wasn't recorded due to BUG_01_010). The app should have recognized existing timestamps (`logged_in`, `contract_signed`, `invoice`) and routed to `payment1` to retry payment_1, or to `balance` if payment_1 had been recorded. Instead, it routed to contract as if it was a completely fresh login, ignoring all existing state timestamps.

**Expected**: 
- If `payment_1` not recorded: Route to `payment1` (to retry payment_1)
- If `payment_1` recorded: Route to `balance` (for payment_2)
- Should recognize `logged_in`, `contract_signed`, `invoice` timestamps

**Actual**: Routed to `contract` page, completely ignoring all existing timestamps

**Root Cause**: 
- **JSON Caching**: `fetchJobData()` was fetching JSON without cache busting, so browser/CDN may have served stale cached version without timestamps
- **Routing Logic**: Sequential `if` statements could overwrite each other incorrectly
- **No Debugging**: No logging to verify what state values were actually read

**Console Log**:
```
No session_id found in URL or sessionStorage
Event: contract_loaded
```

**Fixes Implemented** (2026-01-17):
- **Cache Busting**: Added `?t=${Date.now()}` query parameter and explicit cache headers (`cache: 'no-store'`, `Cache-Control: no-cache`) to `fetchJobData()` in `src/lib/data.ts`
- **State Logging**: Added comprehensive logging in `fetchJobData()` to show all timestamp values when data loads
- **Routing Logic**: Refactored routing to use `else if` chain with proper precedence instead of sequential `if` statements that could overwrite
- **Debug Logging**: Added detailed routing decision logging to track which condition matched and why
- **Safety Checks**: Added validation to ensure `client_status` structure exists before routing

**Files Modified**:
- `src/lib/data.ts`: Added cache busting and state logging
- `src/App.tsx`: Refactored routing logic, added comprehensive debug logging, added safety checks

**Expected Result**: 
- Fresh JSON data always loaded (no stale cache)
- Routing correctly recognizes existing timestamps
- Debug logs show exactly what state values are read and which routing decision is made
- User correctly routed based on their progress through the flow

## Test Job: `uid-nsq-976.json`

### BUG_01_012 - Multiple Workflow Runs Still Occurring, Payment Events Not Recorded

**Date**: 2026-01-17  
**Status**: Fixed

**Issue**: Workflow still runs multiple times:
1. **First workflow (#30)**: Successfully records `logged_in`, `contract_signed`, `invoice`, and contract signatures
2. **Second workflow (#31)**: Attempts to record `payment_1` but fails with git merge conflict (exit code 128)
3. **Third workflow (#32)**: Sees "Processing 2 events" but reports "No state changes required" - payment_1 never recorded

**Expected**: Single workflow run that processes ALL events (including payment) together  
**Actual**: Three separate workflow runs, payment_1 not recorded

**Root Cause**: 
- Webhook triggers separate workflow run for payment events
- Frontend flushes its own batch of events separately
- These two separate workflow runs conflict with each other
- User correctly identified: "Every instance of this bug would have worked properly if not for the action running multiple times"

**User Insight**: "It seems like it would be a more direct and complete, long term solution if we were to, instead, get all of the events that are added to the JSON after the user's session to be written to the JSON at the same time."

**Fixes Implemented** (2026-01-17):
- **Removed webhook workflow trigger**: Webhook no longer triggers separate workflow run
- **Frontend includes payment event**: When payment completes, frontend adds payment event to buffer BEFORE flushing
- **Single batch processing**: All events (including payment) are flushed together as one batch
- **Updated Effect 2**: Now calls `trackEvent()` for payment events and includes them in the batch flush

**Files Modified**:
- `src/App.tsx`: Updated Effect 2 to add payment event to buffer before flushing
- `api/webhook.js`: Removed workflow trigger, now only logs payment completion

**Expected Result**: Single workflow run processes all events together atomically, no conflicts

### BUG_01_013 - Return URL Still Redirects to Contract (JSON Shows All Null Timestamps)

**Date**: 2026-01-17  
**Status**: Fixed

**Issue**: After successful payment, return URL redirects to contract. Console shows:
```
✅ Loaded job data for uid-nsq-976: {logged_in: null, contract_signed: null, invoice: null, payment_1: null, balance: null, …}
📍 Routing: no progress detected → contract (default)
```

**Expected**: Return URL should show completion page  
**Actual**: Routes to contract because JSON shows all null timestamps

**Root Cause**: 
- JSON file being served has all null timestamps (stale cached version)
- Even though workflow successfully committed timestamps to GitHub
- Vercel CDN/browser is caching the old JSON file
- Cache busting query parameter may not be enough if CDN ignores it

**Fixes Implemented** (2026-01-17):
- **Added cache headers to vercel.json**: JSON files now have `Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate` headers
- **Cache busting already in place**: `fetchJobData()` already uses `?t=${Date.now()}` query parameter
- **Explicit no-cache headers**: Ensures CDN and browser don't cache JSON files

**Files Modified**:
- `vercel.json`: Added cache headers for `/assets/jobs/*.json` files

**Expected Result**: JSON files always served fresh, timestamps correctly read, routing works

---

### BUG_01_014 - State Management Still Shows All Null Timestamps on Second Login

**Date**: 2026-01-17  
**Status**: Fixed (same root cause as BUG_01_013)

**Issue**: User logged in again 30 minutes after BUG_01_013. Console shows:
```
✅ Loaded job data for uid-nsq-976: {logged_in: null, contract_signed: null, invoice: null, payment_1: null, balance: null, …}
📍 Routing: no progress detected → contract (default)
```

**Expected**: Should recognize existing timestamps and route to appropriate section  
**Actual**: All timestamps show as null, routes to contract

**Root Cause**: Same as BUG_01_013 - JSON file being served is stale cached version

**Fixes Implemented**: Same as BUG_01_013 - cache headers added to prevent JSON caching

**Files Modified**: Same as BUG_01_013

**Expected Result**: JSON files always fresh, state management correctly recognizes progress

## Test Job: `uid-unc-480.json`

### BUG_01_015 - Checkout Session Return URL Redirect

**Date**: 2026-01-17  
**Status**: Fixed

**Issue**: After payment completes, return URL redirects to contract instead of completion page. Console shows all null timestamps because workflow hasn't run yet to update JSON state.

**Expected**: Return URL should route to completion page (`completion1` or `completion2`) based on which payment completed  
**Actual**: Routes to contract because JSON state shows all null timestamps

**Root Cause**: 
- Routing logic relies on `client_status` JSON state to determine which completion page to show
- When payment completes and Stripe redirects, workflow hasn't updated JSON yet
- All timestamps are null → routing logic defaults to contract

**User Solution Discovery**: Add explicit `complete=payment_X` parameter to return URL to identify which payment completed, similar to how `session_id` parameter works.

**Fixes Implemented** (2026-01-17):
- **Updated return_url construction** in `src/App.tsx` `createCheckoutSession()`:
  - Changed from: `${window.location.origin}/${jobId}?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`
  - Changed to: `${window.location.origin}/${jobId}?complete=payment_${paymentNumber}&session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`
  - Uses `&` (ampersand) for second parameter
- **Updated routing logic** in `src/App.tsx`:
  - Check for `complete` URL parameter FIRST (before checking JSON state)
  - If `complete=payment_1` → route to `completion1`
  - If `complete=payment_2` → route to `completion2`
  - This works even when JSON state is null
- **Enhanced CompletionView component** (`src/components/CompletionView.tsx`):
  - Different content for `completion1` vs `completion2`
  - `completion1`: "Payment Received" message, next steps, download contract/invoice, optional "Pay balance now" button
  - `completion2`: "All Payments Complete" message, download all PDFs, thank you message, contact info

**Files Modified**:
- `src/App.tsx`: Updated return_url construction and routing logic
- `src/components/CompletionView.tsx`: Enhanced with different content for each completion type

**Expected Result**: Return URL correctly routes to completion page even when JSON state is null

### BUG_01_016 - User Exit Events Workflow Issues & Return User State Placement

**Date**: 2026-01-17  
**Status**: Fixed

**Issue**: 
1. Payment event not included in workflow batch - workflow #35 received `logged_in` and `contract_loaded` (already processed) but `payment_1` event never made it into batch
2. Commit hash references are wrong - workflow #34 references commit `1d14aad` which was before testing started
3. Return user state placement - second login shows all null timestamps, routes to contract

**Expected**: 
- Single workflow run processes all events (including payment) together
- Commit hash references should match actual commits
- Second login should recognize existing timestamps and route correctly

**Actual**: 
- Multiple workflow runs, payment event sent separately
- Commit hash references are incorrect
- Second login shows all nulls, routes to contract

**Root Causes**:
1. **Payment Event Timing**: Payment event was being added to buffer AFTER redirect (in Effect 2), but on redirect it's a new page load so buffer is empty. Payment event needs to be tracked when return URL loads.
2. **Commit Hash Issue**: GitHub Actions checkout step wasn't explicitly using workflow's commit SHA
3. **Deduplication Logging**: Events like `logged_in` and `contract_loaded` were being processed even though they were already set, causing "No state changes required" message

**Fixes Implemented** (2026-01-17):
- **Fixed payment event timing** in `src/App.tsx`:
  - Add payment event to buffer when checkout session is created (before redirect)
  - Also add payment event when return URL loads (as backup, since redirect is new page load)
  - Update event with actual session_id when session is created
  - Flush immediately when return URL loads
- **Fixed commit hash issue** in `.github/workflows/user-exit-events.yml`:
  - Added explicit `ref: ${{ github.sha }}` to checkout step
  - Added `fetch-depth: 0` to ensure full history
- **Improved deduplication logging** in `.github/scripts/orchestration/user_exit_events.py`:
  - Added logging for `logged_in`, `contract_signed`, `invoice`, `balance` events when already processed
  - Added handling for `contract_loaded` event (informational only, skip silently)
  - All events now show clear logging when skipped vs when processed

**Files Modified**:
- `src/App.tsx`: Fixed payment event timing, added to buffer before redirect and on return URL load
- `.github/workflows/user-exit-events.yml`: Added explicit commit reference to checkout step
- `.github/scripts/orchestration/user_exit_events.py`: Improved deduplication logging for all event types

**Expected Result**: 
- Payment event included in workflow batch
- Commit hash references are correct
- Deduplication logging shows which events were skipped
- Single workflow run processes all events together

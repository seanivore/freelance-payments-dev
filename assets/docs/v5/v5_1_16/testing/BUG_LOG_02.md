**SOLUTION for BUG_02_001**

1. Remove the button to continue to make next payment 
2. Replace with language added "Please return to the payments site and login to make your final payment." 

**SOLUTION for BUG_02_002**

  1. If there is an obvious fix that will not upset other working functionality, then make it now. However, this is not a big issue because as of now the completed JSON job file is so very quickly removed from the project directory — it happens just one push, made for whatever reason, following the user-exit-events.yml workflow running triggered from payment_2 checkout session completion, with Completion2 shown to user. Therefore we do not want to risk any major changes that could put overall, tested functionality, as risk. 

  2. We should then clean up the assets/docs/... directory. We want to organize all of the documents from finalizing the build, all testing into, and then update our documentation. The following change have been made. 

     - Created assets/docs/v5/v5_0_0/... directory 
     - Placed most original planning and documentation there 
       `assets/docs/v5/v5_0_0/AI_CONTEXT_PRIMER.md`
       `assets/docs/v5/v5_0_0/CURRENT_STATE.md`
       `assets/docs/v5/v5_0_0/EXEC_PLAN_FINAL.md`
       `assets/docs/v5/v5_0_0/NECESSARY_CONTEXT.md`
       `assets/docs/v5/v5_0_0/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`
     - Created assets/docs/v5/v5_1_16/... directory 
     - Moved the Stripe checkout sessions quickstart guide there and testing directory there 
       `assets/docs/v5/v5_1_16/QUICKSTART_CHECKOUT_SESSIONS/...` 
       `assets/docs/v5/v5_1_16/testing/...`
     - Created assets/docs/v5/v5_2_0/... directory 

  3. The following changes, review of old files, and planning file updates need to be made. 

     - Transform this document `assets/docs/v5/v5_1_16/testing/BUG_LOG_02.md` into a new main log document `assets/docs/v5/v5_1_16/testing/LOG_02.md` with whatever action steps were taken after my writing this, given the notes above and the rest of this step's changes to be made 
     - Review our original documentation to identify and confirm if we've completed everything and then consolidate things into the following noted new documents. If there is anything else that remains that I didn't cover in the rest of the bullets below, please don't hesitate to create other documents in the new versioning directory at `assets/docs/v4/v5_2_0/...`

     **OLD**
     `assets/docs/v5/v5_0_0/AI_CONTEXT_PRIMER.md`
     `assets/docs/v5/v5_0_0/CURRENT_STATE.md`
     `assets/docs/v5/v5_0_0/EXEC_PLAN_FINAL.md`
     `assets/docs/v5/v5_0_0/NECESSARY_CONTEXT.md`
     `assets/docs/v5/v5_0_0/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`

     - Create a new file that should be our main source of technical documentation that will also be able to serve as the one-stop-shop content priming for future AI agents working on this project. We'll want to be sure that they will fully understand the project's architecture, with all of it quirks and novelty — pulling from the originally planned architecture from `assets/docs/RESOURCES/OG_JSON_ARCH_PORTFOLIO.md`, from our previous most-up-to-date-but-not-complete `assets/docs/v5/v5_0_0/AI_CONTEXT_PRIMER.md` — and also include our development philosophy and other forward planning — that you recapped well in `assets/docs/v5/v5_0_0/EXEC_PLAN_FINAL.md` pulling from `assets/docs/v5/v5_0_0/CURRENT_STATE.md` and `assets/docs/v5/v5_0_0/NECESSARY_CONTEXT.md` — and then lets be sure to define the role of every file in the project directory — which we can use as a way to also clean up the directory, for which I've pasted the current project directory structure below — and then let's also map out the user flow, how data flows, how setup of new jobs works, and end-to-end job lifespan — anything else important from `assets/docs/v5/v5_0_0/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` — whatever is necessary to pickup this project and make any new fixes or addition of features, etc. making sure that it can be understood from a variety of different perspectives. 

     **NEW**
     `assets/docs/PAYMENTS_PLATFORM.md`

     - And then, when going through the old documentation, anything else that is left to do, including the current details for visual design updates that were planned but not yet finished. Please make sure any previously communicated emphasis from the prior documentation, in addition to an emphasis on the fact that this platform is a place where clients who are paying me for high-bar design work — usually clients identify me because my visual work stands out — and thus we can't send them through a platform that doesn't speak to that, particularly because it is something that they will use before work on their projects even starts, giving them a strong first impression should be our goal. Please address any changes that have already been mentioned, as well as any that you expect will be needed or will help set the project apart, creating that great first impression. I did really like the original homepage we had because of the visual effect following the mouse — the original description starts here `assets/docs/v1/v1_DEV_PLAN.md` referencing this CSS for the rest of the august.style portfolio aesthetic `assets/docs/v1/EXAMPLE_FILES/styles_example.css` and then further detailed in `assets/docs/v2/MODULAR_REFACTOR_PLANNING.md` under the heading "Design UI & UX Flow, Interrupted" — which seems like a good place to start. 
     - Finally, as a **more legitimate long term solution to "BUG_02_002"** — and why all of this information started out being written here before turning into a huge detailed wrap-up — I'd like to have a guide, as detailed as possible, to send copies of the PDFs to the client user when they complete their payment_2, as well as an automated email thanking them for the payment_1 completion. We might want to take advantage of our current OAuth Google API setup, or maybe there is a better alternative, I'm not sure. It would need to include changing the "download/view" confirmation gating step on InvoiceView and BalanceView to just "Clicking continue acknowledges you've viewed these documents. You'll be taken to make your first payment and a copy of your documents will be available to download in the thank you email received in response to you payment." Something along those lines. We'll still have a download button for them at those phases but it can be off to the side and not called attention to. We should also note that the final payment_2 email should send actual attached PDFs with the email because when that final payment is made, the system immediately starts the process of archiving the job details inside the payments platform. This will ensure that the client 100% has their documents clearing my end of any liability before the job is closed out in the platform, without us needed to make any changes to the current system other than those noted. Any other necessary details and as much detail as possible is greatly appreciated. 

     **NEW** 
     `assets/docs/v5/v5_2_0/DESIGN_UPDATES.md` 
     `assets/docs/v5/v5_2_0/IMPL_EMAIL_PDFS.md`

BUG_02_001 — First user session, Completion1 button doesn't move user forward 

TEST FILE: uid-qee-576.json
LOGIN KEYS: Miller -- last-resort 
TEST STATE: Completely new job file setup accurately 

1. Login as a first time visiting user 
2. Sign contract, view invoice, make payment_1 
3. Click continue to payment_2 on Completion1 page 

EXPECTED: Clicking button to continue should have loaded the Balance PDF allowing user to download/view, then proceed to make payment_2 

ACTUAL: Clicking the continue to make payment_2 button on Completion1 shows the contract load in the background but the Completion1 view continues to appear

RESULTS: Accurate behavior for user returning later to make payment_2 

TEST FILE: uid-bnp-832.json
LOGIN KEYS: Anderson -- jake-acts 
TEST STATE: Completed through payment_1 with accurate events recorded to JSON 

1. Login as a returning user 
2. Downloaded/viewed balance PDF 
3. Made final payment_2
4. Viewed the Completion2 page 
5. Next local smart-push pulled JSON that was all updated properly and the Product was marked as no longer active, which then archived the product in the actual Stripe catalog 

Expected and Actual behavior are in sync. 

Next test should try using the buttons on Complete2 to download the various files

BUG_02_002 — Completed user returning not served Complete2 **NOT SURE how relevant this is given the rest of the testing and the current accurate expected behavior**

Possibly because of it not loading the updated JSON. The JSON was updated accurately, but console log displayed says that it is not. Accurate JSON available remote, not pulled locally. However, as things stand the job's JSON is only available at all for a limited amount of time. 

TEST FILE: uid-oac-784.json
LOGIN KEYS: Mobile -- town-seams 
TEST STATE: Completed up through payment_1 with accurate events recorded to JSON 

1. User returns login sends them to view balance then make payment_2 
2. User clicks the download buttons on Completion2 and gets accurate documents 

Expected and actual behavior are in sync for session 1. 

Next test SESSION 2 is to login as this same job and see if Completion2 still loads accurately. 

Note -- the JSON in jobs file in live directory was checked and all updates were added, all timestamps are added and the product has been marked as not active, however it won't be until the next push that these updates will be recognized by Stripe for the actual product to be archived. All of this is expected and should have no unexpected effect on actual behavior. 

1. Testing continued, user login again even though all payments are complete and JSON reflects this 
2. User clicks the download buttons on Completion2 to get accurate documents 

Expected: User is served the Completion2 view because they have made all payments 

Actual: User is sent to "balance" after login and you can see that the console log does not see that the "balance" timestamp does actually exist on the live JSON 

User will repeat for SESSION 3 

Expected: User is served the Completion2 view because they have made all payments

Actual: Same as session 2, the user is still sent to balance as the JSON value on current live JSON is not recognized 

NOTE: AI please review log_1 bug fixes because we had these issues for the user login and their being routed inaccurately to Complete1 instead of accurately sent to balance PDF. This seems similar, but you can see in the logs that, while the previous JSON timestamps are seen, the later updates are not.

This time, the difference will be that the local repo was updated and so needed to be pushed from local. 

Note before pushing, on GitHub repo is shown with the previous test that was marked Product active = false, for which the Stripe catalog product was archived on the next push, the JSON file for that job was deleted from the directory as expected. This was "uid-bnp-832.json". These changes haven't been pulled to local yet. 

The JSON uid-oac-784.json was also updated to Product active = false, however because there were no events or other workflow push made since those JSON changes were made live, the Stripe catalog product was not archived yet. These changes haven't been pulled to local yet. This also means that the uid-oac-784.json still exists locally as that is not deleted until two pushes after the update because the JSON file is updated when the system recognizes that there is no matching Stripe catalog product and the JSON is marked not active. This is all expected and accurate behavior. 

Now that these details have been recorded and this file saved to the repo locally, I will push these changes.

Pleasantly surprised to see that in the same push the JSON marked "inactive" because of payment completion had the Stripe catalog product archived and then the JSON job was also deleted from the directory. All changes were pulled locally. 

This means that the attempt to login for TEST JOB uid-oac-784.json was no longer possible. 

Because of this expected behavior, there doesn't seem to be reason to overemphasize the need for a user login after making all payments to be redirected to the Completion2 page again, because after one push following the event tracking updates of a user making final payments, the JSON for that job will no longer be available and login no longer possible.

TEST FILE: uid-qee-576.json
LOGIN KEYS: Miller -- last-resort 
TEST STATE: Completed through payment_1 with accurate events recorded to JSON 

1. User logged in and went to make payment_2
2. User was routed to balance accurately then made payment_2
3. User used card that was declined accurately and new card allowed payment to process 
4. User was redirected to Completion2 accurately 
5. Changes were pulled locally, this file was updated and then pushed 
6. Changes were pulled locally, this time meaning the job was deleted from the directory and Stripe catalog product archived
